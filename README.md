## 🕵️ About

Weather forecast application with a focus on testing (component testing, mocks, hook testing, coverage report, integration testing)

## 💻 Running the application

<p>To run the project, simply run the following commands in your terminal with git</p>

```bash
   # Make a clone of the repository

   git clone <https://github.com/BereniceQueiroz/iweather>

   # Install dependencies

   yarn

```

<p>If you are running the project within Android Studio, replace the "um-ip-any" field, along with the angle brackets, with "10.0.2.2", which is equivalent to localhost, within the platform. However, if you decide to run the app on your physical device, replace this field with your computer's current IP.
